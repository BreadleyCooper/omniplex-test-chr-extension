# Chrome Extension for Omniplex Tech Test


## Description

A chrome extension that shows a pop-up log in, stores the log in data and monitors for a 5s period of inactivity


### Challenges and Problems encountered

This was the first time making a chrome extension so it was great learning how they're made.


### What could be improved

The password should of course be securely stored! I would implement a secure hash system if this were a real project.


## Getting Started

Donwload and unzip the code file. 

Open Google Chrome extension manager, make sure Dev Mode is turned on. 

Click on "Load unpacked" and select the root file.

**Make sure to refresh the page you want monitoring if it's already open when you install the extension**

Clicking on the extension will show a popup to sign in. User can be anything (max 28char). Password must be "Password". 

Enjoy being monitored ;)
