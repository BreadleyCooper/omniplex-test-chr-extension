# Chrome Extension for Omniplex Tech Test


## Description

A chrome extension that shows a pop-up log in, stores the log in data and monitors for a 5s period of inactivity


### Challenges and Problems encountered

### What could be improved

The password should of course be securely stored! I would implement a secure hash system if this were a real project.
